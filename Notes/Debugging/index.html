    <h1>Plan -> Write -> Debug -> Repeat.</h1>
    <p>Three parts of programming: algorithm planning, actually writing the code, and debugging</p>

<p>Algorithm: The steps or process to the program. What are you going to be coding? How are you going to program it?
    Computers will follow algorithms to the exact description. You can't make it assume.
To plan an Algorithm:
    Write or draw it on paper. Use English to describe inputs, outputs, and steps. Provide a few examples.
        Run it through your head as a sanity check, and check where it may be unclear.</p>

<p>Writing Code:
    Translating the algorithm into JavaScript to run on the computer. 
    Often will be difficult because of the unclarity of the algorithm (you missed steps) or hard time
        identifying the syntax.
    When planning, also think about what all you'll have to code.
    Identify your resources. You'll need to remember how to write the code sometimes.
        Mozilla Developer Network, W3Schools, Books, and Notes are great resources.
        You'll remember the syntax over time. If you want to get faster, write more code.</p>

<p>Debugging
    Even after working for years and years, you WILL have errors.
    Two types of errors will occur: Logical and Syntax. 
    The Web Console really helps for debugging. It'll tell you WHERE the code went wrong.

    Syntax Error:
        Happens when you write code that isn't JavaScript.
        Typically end up highlighted in your Code Editor
        Must be fixed ASAP. You can't go further if you have a syntax error.

        Fixing:
            Re-read the code, look for misplaced characters.
            Compare it to working code.
            Delete the code and reqrite it.
            Check the {brackets}.

    Logical Error:
        Occur when the computer executes the program, but doesn't do what you expected it to do.
        There's usually a mismatch between how you thought the program is working versus how it actually is working.
        To fix them, it requires gathering info about what the computer did do, and rethinking the algorithm.
        They're the ones the experienced programmers spend their most time on.</p>

<p>The Web Console
    Shows any errors in the code
    Runtime errors need to be fixed too!
    Can display data from your program using console.log.
        It'll force your computer to tell you about the program state. You may think a veriable has '5,' console will prove that.
    Any errors within the console must be fixed immediately.
